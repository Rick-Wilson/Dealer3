# Deprecated Switches in dealer3

This document lists all dealer.exe switches that are **not supported** in dealer3 and explains why. When users try to use these switches, they receive helpful error messages guiding them to alternatives.

---

## Status: ✅ All Deprecated Switches Implemented

All 5 deprecated switches are now recognized and produce helpful error messages.

---

## Deprecated Switches

### 1. `-2` - 2-Way Swapping Mode

**Status**: ❌ Not Supported
**Reason**: Incompatible with predeal functionality

**Error Message**:
```
Error: Switch '-2' (2-way swapping) is not supported in dealer3.

Reason: Swapping modes are incompatible with predeal functionality,
        which is a core feature of dealer3.

Suggestion: Remove the '-2' switch from your command.
            If you need swapping, use the original dealer.exe.
```

**What it did in dealer.exe**:
- After each shuffle, generate another deal by swapping E and W
- Leaves N and S in place
- Incompatible with predeal

**Why not supported**:
- Predeal is a more useful feature than swapping
- Swapping and predeal are fundamentally incompatible
- Low user demand for swapping feature

---

### 2. `-3` - 3-Way Swapping Mode

**Status**: ❌ Not Supported
**Reason**: Incompatible with predeal functionality

**Error Message**:
```
Error: Switch '-3' (3-way swapping) is not supported in dealer3.

Reason: Swapping modes are incompatible with predeal functionality,
        which is a core feature of dealer3.

Suggestion: Remove the '-3' switch from your command.
            If you need swapping, use the original dealer.exe.
```

**What it did in dealer.exe**:
- After each shuffle, generate 5 more deals by permuting E, W, and S
- Leaves N in place
- Incompatible with predeal

**Why not supported**:
- Same reasons as `-2`
- Even less compatible with predeal (more positions swapped)

---

### 3. `-e` - Exhaust Mode

**Status**: ❌ Not Supported
**Reason**: Experimental feature never completed

**Error Message**:
```
Error: Switch '-e' (exhaust mode) is not supported in dealer3.

Reason: Exhaust mode was an experimental alpha feature in dealer.exe
        that was never completed or documented.

Suggestion: Remove the '-e' switch from your command.
```

**What it was supposed to do**:
- Unknown - experimental feature marked as "alpha version" in dealer.exe
- Never documented in the manual
- Never completed by original author

**Why not supported**:
- No clear specification of what it should do
- Not documented in dealer.exe manual
- No known users depending on this feature

---

### 4. `-u` - Upper/Lowercase Toggle

**Status**: ❌ Not Supported
**Reason**: Cosmetic feature with low priority

**Error Message**:
```
Error: Switch '-u' (upper/lowercase toggle) is not supported in dealer3.

Reason: This is a cosmetic feature with low priority.

Suggestion: Remove the '-u' switch from your command.
            dealer3 uses standard uppercase card symbols (AKQJT).
```

**What it did in dealer.exe**:
- Toggle between uppercase and lowercase for card symbols
- Affects display only: AKQJT vs akqjt

**Why not supported**:
- Purely cosmetic feature
- Low priority compared to functional features
- dealer3 uses standard uppercase (AKQJT)
- Could be added in future if there's demand

---

### 5. `-l` - Library Mode

**Status**: ❌ Not Supported
**Reason**: Conflicting meanings in dealer.exe vs DealerV2_4

**Error Message**:
```
Error: Switch '-l' (library mode) is not supported in dealer3.

Reason: The '-l' switch has conflicting meanings:
        - In dealer.exe: Read deals from library.dat
        - In DealerV2_4: Export to DL52 format

Suggestion: Remove the '-l' switch from your command.
            Future versions may add library support with a different switch.
```

**What it did in dealer.exe**:
- Read pre-generated deals from `library.dat` (M. Ginsberg's library)
- Used with bridge.exe from GIB for fast tricks() evaluation
- INPUT mode (reads deals from file)

**What it does in DealerV2_4**:
- Export deals to DL52 format file
- OUTPUT mode (writes deals to file)

**Why not supported**:
- **Conflicting purposes**: INPUT in dealer.exe, OUTPUT in DealerV2_4
- Implementing either version would break compatibility with the other
- Better to wait for user feedback on which is more important
- Could add `--library-input` and `--dl52-output` in future

---

## Implementation Details

### Code Location
File: [dealer/src/main.rs](../dealer/src/main.rs)

```rust
// Deprecated switches - parse them to show helpful error messages
#[arg(short = '2', hide = true)]
swap_2: bool,

#[arg(short = '3', hide = true)]
swap_3: bool,

#[arg(short = 'e', hide = true)]
exhaust: bool,

#[arg(short = 'u', hide = true)]
uppercase: bool,

#[arg(short = 'l', hide = true)]
library: bool,
```

**Note**: `hide = true` prevents these switches from showing in `--help` output.

### Error Handling
Each deprecated switch is checked in `main()` before normal execution:

```rust
if args.swap_2 {
    eprintln!("Error: Switch '-2' (2-way swapping) is not supported in dealer3.");
    eprintln!();
    eprintln!("Reason: Swapping modes are incompatible with predeal functionality,");
    eprintln!("        which is a core feature of dealer3.");
    eprintln!();
    eprintln!("Suggestion: Remove the '-2' switch from your command.");
    eprintln!("            If you need swapping, use the original dealer.exe.");
    std::process::exit(1);
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Tests

All deprecated switches have been tested:

```bash
# Test each deprecated switch
$ echo "hcp(north) >= 20" | dealer -2 -p 1
Error: Switch '-2' (2-way swapping) is not supported in dealer3.
...

$ echo "hcp(north) >= 20" | dealer -3 -p 1
Error: Switch '-3' (3-way swapping) is not supported in dealer3.
...

$ echo "hcp(north) >= 20" | dealer -e -p 1
Error: Switch '-e' (exhaust mode) is not supported in dealer3.
...

$ echo "hcp(north) >= 20" | dealer -u -p 1
Error: Switch '-u' (upper/lowercase toggle) is not supported in dealer3.
...

$ echo "hcp(north) >= 20" | dealer -l -p 1
Error: Switch '-l' (library mode) is not supported in dealer3.
...
```

✅ All tests passing with helpful error messages

## User Impact

### Positive Impact
- ✅ Clear error messages help users understand what's wrong
- ✅ Provides migration guidance (use dealer.exe for swapping)
- ✅ Explains *why* features aren't supported
- ✅ Better than silent failures or cryptic errors

### Affected Users
- Users migrating from dealer.exe who used swapping modes (likely rare)
- Users who tried experimental `-e` flag (likely none)
- Users who customized card display with `-u` (likely rare)
- Users who used library.dat with `-l` (advanced users only)

### Migration Path
- **Swapping (`-2`, `-3`)**: Use original dealer.exe or remove swapping
- **Exhaust (`-e`)**: Remove switch (feature never worked)
- **Uppercase (`-u`)**: Remove switch (cosmetic only)
- **Library (`-l`)**: Remove switch, wait for future library support

---

## Future Considerations

### Could Be Added Later
1. **Upper/lowercase toggle (`-u`)**: Low priority, cosmetic feature
2. **Library input (`--library-input`)**: If there's demand for library.dat support
3. **DL52 export (`--dl52-output`)**: If there's demand for DealerV2_4 compatibility

### Will NOT Be Added
1. **Swapping modes (`-2`, `-3`)**: Fundamentally incompatible with predeal
2. **Exhaust mode (`-e`)**: No specification of what it should do
